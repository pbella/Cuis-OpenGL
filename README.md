Cuis-OpenGL
===========

# Overview

Cuis-OpenGL is based on my original OpenGL port in Cuis-Ports but is being rebuilt and reorganized to support 'modern' OpenGL based on the programmable pipeline vs the older fixed pipeline in OpenGL 1.x and OpenGL ES 1.x.  While the focus is currently OpenGL ES 2.0 through 3.1, it is being designed in such a way that would allow for the substitution of the full OpenGL API for OpenGL ES without requiring a rewrite.

This repository is currently a placeholder containing the last committed files from the Cuis-Ports version of the OpenGL package.
